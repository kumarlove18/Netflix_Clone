# Netflix_Clone (HTML and CSS)

This repository features a Netflix clone that’s been built entirely with HTML and CSS. 
It's a hands-on project designed to capture the look and feel of Netflix’s user interface, focusing solely on the visual design without using any JavaScript or frameworks.
The goal of this project is to show how much can be achieved with just HTML and CSS. From the navigation menu to the movie thumbnails and hover effects, every detail has been carefully recreated to give you a true Netflix-like experience.
This project is a great way to explore the power of HTML and CSS, especially if you’re looking to improve your web design skills. It’s a simple yet effective way to learn how to build responsive, visually appealing websites that mirror real-world designs.
